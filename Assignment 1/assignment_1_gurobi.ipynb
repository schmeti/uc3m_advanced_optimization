However, in case of the problem being unbounded and the objective function going to infinity in certain directions like in the objective function of Problem 2, the approach taken in MATLAB is unable to find the maximum value as the conditions used to identify optima do not work as they are limited to fininding saddle points or maxima/minima with gradients equal to zero.

    "The Optimization Problem should thus be reconsidered as in its current unbounded form, the optimal x values to maximize would be $x_1 = 0$, $x_2 = -\\infty$, $x_3 = 0$ yielding $f(x)=\\infty$. Overall this is a good example on why black-box solvers need to be used with caution and a good understanding of their limitations."
